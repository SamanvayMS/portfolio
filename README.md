## Work Experience

**Summer Internship @ JIA Finance (_June 2023 - Aug 2023_)**
- Developed an automated system using **OpenAI API**, **LangChain**, and **FAISS/Chroma db** for interpreting mortgage guidelines, facilitating rapid validation of loan requirements using **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
- Engineered task-specific QnA chains and enhanced query handling with a recursive tree approach and LLM-based memoization, improving response accuracy to complex mortgage-related inquiries to 80% (from 55% for direct queries).
  
**Student Practicum @ JIA Finance (_Jan 2023 - May 2023_)**
- Utilized **AWS Sagemaker** and **Redshift** for EDA on over 100M Fannie Mae mortgage records, applying data manipulation and visualization tools for insights.
- Modeled **loan survival** and **default rates**, employing the **Cox Proportional Hazard Model** and assessing the impact of macroeconomic factors.
- Crafted a **comprehensive cash flow model** for **Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS)** integrating credit default, prepayment, and loss severity with a **Cox Ingersoll Ross** interest rate model.

**Student Practicum @ bp Trading (_Aug 2023 - Dec 2023_)**
- Developed a **Forex ladder trading strategy** focusing on grid and lot sizing optimizations to enhance return potential using quantitative methods.
- Sped up tick level backtest up to 2000x using Just-In-Time Compilation on various major currency pairs.
- Applied **hyperparameter tuning** trying with Optuna, PySwarm, DEAP (Genetic Algorithms) and **strategy validation** using Walk-Forward Analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, to refine proprietary trading models.

### DQN Forex trading Agent
- Designed a Trading Env with a custom reward schema using OpenAi Gymnasium and tick level Forex data.

### Aerodynamic developement of a Formula SAE Race car
- Simulated various Airfoil profiles and angle of attack to arrive at the best combination for the Aero package to maximise downforce(negative lift) and minimise drag in **Ansys Fluent**
- Ran height and depth Optimisations for the venturi tunnels to optimise inlet and diffuser height.
- Designed and constructed the Rear Wing, FRont wing and Underbody diffuser package for a model formula student vehicle in **DS Solidworks** adhering to the FSAE rulebook.
- Ran in Depth **3D CFD** simulations of the vehicle with and without the Aerodynamic Package attached and under various road conditions in Ansys Fluent.
- Conducted indepth study of drag andf downforce parameters with a comprehensive visual study to analyse the airflow around the car and the wash behind the car.
- Conducted Track simulations on various FSAE Tracks to verify improvements of proposed package.
